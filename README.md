## My process

I set the Structure of the site first i.e The HTML Content
I Began making changes to the Element using pure CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

--I Learned that the p tag is an inline element that comes in default with a top and bottom margin
--I learned more about the div tag i.e the have overflow set to auto which is it default thats why changes like border-radius wouldn't show when rendered to a div child.

### Continued development

Well i think that would be all for this projects it ends here.
